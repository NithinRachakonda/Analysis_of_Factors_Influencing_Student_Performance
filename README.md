# Student Performance Analysis - Tableau Case Study
This academic project explores the key demographic, behavioral, and socio-economic factors influencing student performance across various schools in Bangladesh. Using Tableau visualizations, the project uncovers patterns that help identify at-risk students and suggest targeted interventions.

## Objective
To analyze the correlation between student demographics (like study group, attendance, parental status, and study time) and academic performance, and derive meaningful insights that institutions can use to improve outcomes.

## Key Analyses
- Study group vs performance comparison
- Impact of attendance on total marks
- Study time thresholds and diminishing returns
- Parental involvement and student outcomes
- Identification of at-risk students (<40% in any subject)

## Insights
- 99% of at-risk students belong to the Arts group.
- Students with <3 hours/week study time are more likely to underperform.
- Better attendance and moderate study time correlate strongly with higher performance.
- Students with no parental support perform significantly worse.

## Conclusion
The dashboard effectively visualizes the drivers of student performance, highlighting the need for targeted tutoring, structured attendance enforcement and curriculum interventionsâ€”especially for at-risk Arts students.
